# Real-Time-Tracking-Ardino-GPS-GSM-

in here we can track our things like Bike or Car Real-time with the help of the arduino 
 is the real project that i made "http://realtimetracking.azurewebsites.net/" , in there you can see the current location and  where the divice is last position with the help of the map flag.
 
 HardeWare :-
          
         1. Arduino uno 
         2. SIM808 Module (it include both GSM and GPS)
         
  
  Software :- 
         
         1. Arduino IDE
         2. Google javaScript MAP api
         3. any host provider (in my project am using Azure host "fast and free")


  Step 1:-
                              
        Upload the code to arduino via Arduino IDE

        Set the gsm sim in SIM808 module and get the GPRS connction
        
  
  Step 2:-
            
        Connect pin's to arduino and sim808 moudel as described as the arduino code 
        :-D
  
  step 3 :-
          
          upload the website code into your website and dont forget to set the google MapApi code in that particluar area,
          
  
  step 4 :
        
        power-up the arduino and finish our tracker work, simple and pimple
